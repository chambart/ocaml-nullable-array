   Designed and tested for OCaml <= 4.04 bytecode and native,
   Taking into consideration:
   * Dynamic float arrays
   * Marshalling
   * no-naked-pointer variant
   * structural equality/comparison functions

   If future version of OCaml runtime and compiler break some
   expected invariants, this library will be updated accordingly.

   Please do not use it with any non-blessed version. Consider
   using the slower, but safer Option array variant.

   Also in general: Please do not write code like that. This rely on
   many compiler implementation details that are impossible to get
   right without knowing the compiler internals !

(* A size n nullable array is a size n+1 array containing a reference
   null value at index 0.

   The n-th field of [a] is considered null iff [a.(n+1) == a.(0)]

   Setting the n-th field to null is done by [a.(n+1) <- a.(0)]

   Setting the n-th field to a given value [v] is simply [a.(n+1) <- v]

   This reference null value in field 0 is required since
   marshalling/unmarshalling destroy sharing (breaking physical
   equality). (See null definition for more details)

   The reference null is in field 0 to avoid needing to read the size
   for accessing it. It implies that any other access requires some
   arithmetic, but this is already the case in OCaml as integers are
   tagged.


   Since nullable arrays can contain both pointers (the null value is
   a pointer) and floating point values, great care is taken to ensure
   that the compiler consider a nullable array as an array containing
   either pointer or integers. This means that float values will be
   boxed and that not dynamic tag check occur when building or
   accessing a nullable array. To achieve this, every manipulation
   must be explicitely annotated with the ['a elt] type.

*)

[@@@ocaml.warning "-37"] (* The type elt is never built *)

type elt =
  | Constant
  | Allocated of int
  (* No value of this type will ever be created, but this type
     annotation is important to ensure that the compiler consider
     those values as 'anything that is not a float'

     When this property is required, the code should be completely
     explicitely annotated. *)

type null = { mutable null : int }
let null : elt = Obj.magic { null = 0 }
(* The null value is encoded as a value for which the semantics of
   physical equality is completely defined.

   We could either choose a mutable value or an exception. Exceptions
   have the nice benefic of being able to be statically allocated as
   they are not mutable, but this is problematic for structural
   equality: exceptions are structuraly equal if they are physicaly
   equal, which we cannot ensure when a value is built by
   unmarshalling. There is only a single instance of the null value
   explicitely created, but other instances can be created through
   unmarshal.

   Note that the 0 value could have been use with the classic
   runtime, but would break the no-naked-pointer invariant of never
   having a pointer outside of the heap that does not look like a
   black OCaml value, which of course cannot be achieved with 0.
   Future version of the runtime could be made to understant the
   0 pointer. If this happen, this value could be created as:

   {[
     external int_as_pointer : int -> elt = "%int_as_pointer"
     let null : elt = int_as_pointer 0

     let nullf () : elt = int_as_pointer 0 [@@ocaml.inline]
   ]}

   Note that nullf might be faster in general since the compiler might
   not able to constant fold the primitive (which will probably never
   happen as this is not a valid OCaml value and has no valid
   representation in either closure or flambda approximations) it will
   still be able to inline the function which will easily produce the
   expected efficient code. *)
